### Understanding IF Statement in Python ###

# 1. Input marks of a student and show the grade they secured

# Ask for user input
# n = int(input("enter your marks"))
# #if functions
# if n>0 and n<60:
#     print("sorry you got an F")
# elif n>60 and n<70:
#     print("sorry you got a D")
# elif n>69 and n<80:
#     print("you got a C")
# elif n>79 and n<90:
#     print(" good job you got a B")
# elif n>89 and n<100:
#     print("good job you got an A")
# elif n == 100:
#     print("good job you got an A+")
# elif n>100 and n<110:
#     print("good job you scored bonus")
# else:
#     print("please enter a reasonable mark")




# 2. Guess my secret code
#
# n = 5
# a = int(input("enter you guess"))
# if a==n:
#     print("you got it right!")
# else:
#     print("you got it wrong...try again.")
#     b = int(input("enter your second guess"))
#     if b==n:
#         print("you got it right!")
#     else:
#         print("you got it wrong...try again.")
#         c = int(input("enter your third guess"))
#         if c == n:
#             print("you got it right!")
#         else:
#             print("you got it wrong...")
#


#3. is it raining?
#
# n = input("are there liquid droplets falling from the atmosphere right now?")
# if n == "no":
#     print("its not raining")
#     a = input("do you have school today?")
#     if a=="no":

#     elif a=="yes":
#         print("then go your gonna be late and you dont need an umbrella")
#     else:
#         print("yes or no question")
# elif n=="yes":
#     print("its raining")
#     b = input("do you have school today?")
#     if b == "no":
